<h1 align="center">Email Trick Generator ✨
</h1><i>The Email Trick Generator is a simple web tool. You give it your main email address, and it creates unique variations of it. The best part is, all the mail sent to these new addresses still lands right in your primary inbox. This is super useful for organizing your emails, tracking where you've signed up for things, and managing your digital footprint without having to make a bunch of new accounts.</i>

## The Story Behind This Project

I've always been interested in finding ways to test the limits of online platforms. I noticed that many services, when you sign up, don't have good systems to prevent people from creating multiple accounts. I wanted to see if I could use a simple trick to create countless signups without ever having to create a new email account.

That's why I made the Email Trick Generator. It’s a simple tool that takes your main email address and creates unique variations of it. Using Gmail's "dot trick," all of these variations will still send mail directly to your primary inbox. This makes it easy to sign up for something multiple times

## What It Does
The Gmail Dot Trick: If you use Gmail, you might know that adding or removing dots from your email address doesn't change where the email goes. For example, emails sent to both john.doe@gmail.com and johndoe@gmail.com will land in the same inbox. My tool automatically generates all these possible dot variations for you.

Business Plus Tagging: Many email providers, like Gmail and Outlook, let you add a plus sign followed by a custom "tag" to your email address. For example, yourname+newsletter@example.com will still be delivered to your main inbox. This is a great way to create unlimited email variations. My generator automates this process, and I'm currently working on adding options for custom tags beyond just numbers.

Why this is handy: These tricks are incredibly useful for organizing your inbox. You can create rules in your email settings to automatically sort incoming mail. For instance, you could set up a rule that says, Any email sent to yourname+shopping@example.com should be moved to my Shopping folder.

## Key Features
I focused on making this app intuitive and genuinely useful, with a clean interface:

- **Effortless Generation:** Quickly create numerous dot variations or numerical plus tags.
- **Intuitive & Modern Design:** Built with **HeroUI** and **Tailwind CSS**,works great on any device.
- **Seamless Copying:** Every generated email comes with its own instant copy button, and there's a handy "Copy All" button for bulk tasks.
- **Smart Export Options:** You can easily export your generated email lists into **TXT, CSV, or native Excel (.xlsx) formats** for use in spreadsheets or other tools.
- **Clear Pagination:** For larger lists of emails, the results are neatly paginated, so you can browse without clutter.
- **Dynamic Theme Toggle:** A simple switch lets you choose between light and dark modes for comfortable viewing.

## Technologies I Used
Building this project was a fantastic learning experience, and it gave me the chance to work with a modern web development stack:

- **React 19:** For crafting the interactive and responsive user interface.
- **Vite:** My choice for a lightning-fast development environment and optimized builds.
- **HeroUI:** A beautiful React UI component library that helped me achieve that sleek, minimalist design.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that allowed for rapid and precise styling, bringing the green and black theme to life.
- **Framer Motion:** For those smooth, engaging animations that make the app feel responsive.
- **Lucide React:** Providing the crisp, scalable icons used throughout.
- **React Hot Toast:** For those subtle, helpful notifications (like "Copied!").
- **SheetJS (xlsx):** A powerful library that enabled the native Excel (.xlsx) export functionality.
- **`gh-pages`:** To easily deploy the app to GitHub Pages.
