</h1><i>The Email Trick Generator is a simple web tool. You give it your main email address, and it creates unique variations of it. The best part is, all the mail sent to these new addresses still lands right in your primary inbox. This is super useful for organizing your emails, tracking where you've signed up for things, and managing your digital footprint without having to make a bunch of new accounts.</i>

## The Story Behind This Project

I've always been interested in finding ways to test the limits of online platforms. I noticed that many services, when you sign up, don't have good systems to prevent people from creating multiple accounts. I wanted to see if I could use a simple trick to create countless signups without ever having to create a new email account.

That's why I made the Email Trick Generator. It’s a simple tool that takes your main email address and creates unique variations of it. Using Gmail's "dot trick," all of these variations will still send mail directly to your primary inbox. This makes it easy to sign up for something multiple times

## What It Does
The Gmail Dot Trick: If you use Gmail, you might know that adding or removing dots from your email address doesn't change where the email goes. For example, emails sent to both john.doe@gmail.com and johndoe@gmail.com will land in the same inbox. My tool automatically generates all these possible dot variations for you.

Business Plus Tagging: Many email providers, like Gmail and Outlook, let you add a plus sign followed by a custom "tag" to your email address. For example, yourname+newsletter@example.com will still be delivered to your main inbox. This is a great way to create unlimited email variations. My generator automates this process, and I'm currently working on adding options for custom tags beyond just numbers.

Why this is handy: These tricks are incredibly useful for organizing your inbox. You can create rules in your email settings to automatically sort incoming mail. For instance, you could set up a rule that says, Any email sent to yourname+shopping@example.com should be moved to my Shopping folder.
